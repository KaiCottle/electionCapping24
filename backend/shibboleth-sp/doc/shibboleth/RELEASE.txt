NOTE: The shibboleth2.xml configuration format in this release
is fully compatible with the 2.x releases, but there are significant

A stripped down default configuration and a "full" example file are
included.

    - Generates and optionally signs SAML metadata based on SP configuration

- Status Handler
    - Reports on status and configuration of SP
    
- Session Handler
    - Dumps information about an active session 

- Trust Engines
	- Explicit key and PKIX engines via metadata, superset compatible with 1.3
	- PKIX trust engine with static root list
	
- Configurable per-endpoint Security Policy rules
	- Replay and freshness detection
	- XML signing
	- Simple "blob" signing
	- TLS X.509 certificate authentication
	- SAML condition handling, including delegation support

- Client transport authentication to SOAP endpoints via libcurl
	- TLS X.509 client certificates
	- Basic-Auth
	- Digest-Auth (untested)
	- NTLM (untested)

- Encryption
	- All incoming SAML 2 encrypted element types (Assertion, NameID, Attribute)
	- Optional outgoing encryption of NameID in requests and responses

- General Security
    - Limiting XML security algorithms (with xml-security 1.6+)
    - RSA and ECDSA signatures (EC requires xml-security 1.6+ and support from openssl)
    - AES-GCM encryption (requires xml-security 1.7+ and support from openssl)
    - Metadata-based algorithm selection 

- Attributes
	- Decoding and exporting SAML 1 and 2 attributes
		- Strings
		- Value/scope pairs (legacy and value@scope syntaxes supported)
		- NameIDs
		- Base64 to string
        - XML to base64-encoded XML
		- DOM to internal data structure
		- KeyInfo-based data, including metadata-derived KeyDescriptors
		- Metadata EntityAttributes extension "tags"

- Attribute Filtering
	- Policy language compatible with IdP filtering, except that references
		only work within policy files, not across them
	- Rules based on, attribute issuer, requester, scope, and value, authentication
		method, based on exact string and regular expressions.
    - Boolean functions supporting AND, OR, and NOT for use in composing rules
    - Wildcard rules allowing all unspecified attributes through with no filtering

- Assertion Export
	- Oversized header replaced with Shib-Assertion-Count and Shib-Assertion-NN headers
		containing local URL to fetch SAML assertion using HTTP GET

- Enhanced Spoofing Detection
	- Detects and blocks client headers that would match known attribute headers
	- Key-based mechanism to handle internal server redirection while maintaining protection

- ODBC Clustering Support
	- Tested against a few different servers with various drivers

- RequestMap enhancements
    - Regular expression matching for hosts and paths
    - Query string parameter matching

- Error handling enhancements
    - Reporting of SAML status errors
    - Optional redirection to custom error handler

- Form POST data preservation
    - Support on Apache for preserving URL-encoded form data across SSO 

- Apache module enhancements
    - Apache 2.4 support including authz 
    - "OR" coexistence with other authz modules on older Apache
    - htaccess-based override of any valid RequestMap property
    - htaccess support for external access control plugins

- Command line tools

    - mdquery for interrogating via metadata configuration
    - resolvertest for exercising attribute extraction, filtering, and resolution
